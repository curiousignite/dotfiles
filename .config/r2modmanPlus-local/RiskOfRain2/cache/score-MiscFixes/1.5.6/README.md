# Misc Fixes

Designed to comprehensively address the bugs and exceptions that game updates introduce, and attempts to soften the impact that breaking changes have on the existing mod ecosystem, primarily through Harmony based IL hooks. It also applies a small amount of game integrity focused asset updates, and provides tools to assist with safely developing around error prone aspects of the game code.

Note that these changes are NOT intended to modify the vanilla gameplay experience. If it's even debatable on whether or not it's in line with the "intended" vanilla experience, it doesn't belong here.
